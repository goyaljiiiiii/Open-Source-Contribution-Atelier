# ⚠️ Merge Conflict Resolution

### When two branches modify the exact same line of a file, Git doesn't know which version to keep. This triggers a **Merge Conflict**.

## 🚨 Understanding Conflict Markers

When a conflict happens, Git pauses and writes markers directly into the files:

```md
<<<<<<< HEAD
Our changes here (on the target branch)
=======
Their changes here (on the feature branch)

> > > > > > > feature-branch-name
```

## ✅ Resolving Conflict Markers

You need to resolve these conflict markers in the files.

---

### 1️⃣ Approach 1 : Git/CLI (Terminal)

To resolve:

**1.** Open the file in your code editor.

**2.** Edit the file to choose the correct code, and delete the Git markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

**3.** Save the file.

### 1️⃣ Approach 2 : GitHub

---

**1. Click 'Resolve Conflicts' and Locate the conflict markers:**
   Scroll through the file to find the highlighted conflict sections.
   
   _GitHub will visually group the conflict markers, separated by:_

   ```<<<<<<<``` (Your branch's changes)
   
   ```=======``` (The divider line)
   
   ```>>>>>>>``` (The changes from the branch you are merging into)

---

**2. Edit the file directly:**
   Decide which code you want to keep. Delete the unwanted code lines and manually delete all the Git conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).

---

**3. Mark as Resolved:**
   Once all markers in that specific file are gone and the code looks correct, click the "Mark as resolved" button in the top-right corner of that file's box.

---

**4. Commit the changes:**
   Repeat the process for any other conflicting files. Once all conflicts are resolved, click the "Commit merge" button at the top to finalize the merge back into your branch.

## ⚡ Continuing after Resolution

Once you resolve conflicts in a file:

**1.** Stage the file:
   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```

**2.** Continue the paused rebase process:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

---

> [!TIP]
> - You may also resolve conflict markers on GitHub if you prefer that method, not just with Git from your terminal.
> - Run the resume command in your terminal to continue your rebase once conflict resolution is staged: `git rebase --continue`
