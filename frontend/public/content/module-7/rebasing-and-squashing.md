# 🏗️ Rebasing & Squashing

### In large open source projects, commit histories can quickly become messy. Maintainers prefer clean, linear histories using **rebase** and **squash**.

## 🔨 What is Rebasing?

**Rebasing** is the process of combining or moving a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Instead of a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history by applying your branch's changes one-by-one on top of the target branch (e.g. `main`).

```plaintext
Before Rebase:

      A---B---C (feature)
     /
D---E---F---G (📍 main)


After Rebase:

              A'--B'--C' (feature)
             /
D---E---F---G (📍 main)
```

## 📥 What is Squashing?

**Squashing** combines multiple local commits (e.g. `fix typo`, `add test`, `fix lint`) into a single, clean commit (e.g. `feat: add email verification`) before merging. This keeps the project's main branch log neat.

## 🔄 Syncing with Rebase

To update your feature branch with the latest changes on `main`, run this in your terminal:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

## 🆚 Merge vs. Rebase vs. Squash

| Feature | 🔗 Git Merge | 🔨 Git Rebase | 📥 Git Squash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Concept** | Combines branches by creating a new merge commit | Applies commits from one branch onto another | Combines many commits into a single commit |
| **History Impact** | Keeps the full history of all branches | Gives commits new IDs while applying them on top of another branch | Compresses changes and drops extra commit messages |
| **Best Practice** | It lets you merge feature branches into the main branch on team projects | It lets you keep a clean and linear history, but never rebase shared branches | It lets you clean up the feature branch before merging, but never squash a shared branch |
| **Pros** | Safe, easy to undo, simple to understand | Linear history, easier to understand and debug | Clean history and allows one commit per feature |
| **Cons** | Extra merge commits can clutter history | Risk of confusion and conflicts on shared branches from changed commit IDs | Harder to revert small parts or trace changes as history gets lost |
