"""
Unit test challenge lesson plugin.

Validates a user-submitted test function by running it against a correct
reference implementation (must pass) and one or more deliberately-buggy
implementations (must fail against at least one). Tests the skill of
*writing tests*, distinct from PythonSandboxPlugin (which tests writing
implementation code).

IMPORTANT: execution of submitted test code MUST reuse the existing
sandboxed execution mechanism from PythonSandboxPlugin in
lesson_plugins.py, not a second independent exec()-based path — running
untrusted code twice, two different ways, in the same codebase is an
avoidable security-review burden. `_run_in_sandbox` below is a thin
wrapper that must be pointed at that real internal method; whoever
implements this should read lesson_plugins.py's actual sandbox interface
first and wire this call accordingly (marked with a clear TODO, not
silently guessed at).
