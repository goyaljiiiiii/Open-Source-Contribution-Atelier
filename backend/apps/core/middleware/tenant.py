"""
TenantContextMiddleware
=======================

Resolves the requesting user's organization (tenant) on every
authenticated request and stores it in the thread-local
:class:`apps.core.tenant` context so that queryset managers and the
:class:`apps.core.mixins.OrganizationScopedQuerySetMixin` can scope
queries automatically.

Resolution order (first match wins):
    1. ``organization_id`` claim on the verified JWT access token
       (populated by ``apps.accounts.jwt.DynamicSaltAccessToken``).
    2. ``request.user.user_profile.organization_id`` (the user's
       default organization profile).
    3. The user's most recent ``OrganizationMembership`` (fallback for
       users without a profile org set but who belong to >=1 org).

If no organization can be resolved, the tenant id is left as ``None``
and tenant-scoped querysets will return empty results — fail-closed.
