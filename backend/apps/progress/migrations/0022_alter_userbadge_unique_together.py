# Manually written to restore an operation that was accidentally dropped
# from migration history across two separate cleanup commits (54393ae and
# 6f31c16), even though apps/progress/models.py already assumes it happened:
# UserBadge was upgraded from a plain `unique_together` to a named
# `UniqueConstraint` ("unique_user_badge_award") for stricter DB-level
# locking. This restores that schema change so migration history matches
# the actual current model state.
