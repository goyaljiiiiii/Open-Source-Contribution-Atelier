ReadAfterWriteMiddleware

Tracks the currently authenticated user in thread-local storage so that
PrimaryReplicaRouter can route their reads to the primary database for a
short window after they have performed a write (read-after-write consistency).

After any mutating request (POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE) for an authenticated
user, the user's ID is written to the cache with a short TTL via
`mark_user_dirty()`.  Subsequent GET requests within that window are then
transparently served from the primary rather than a stale replica.
